## Game Overview

### Game Mechanics:
"Escape from Backrooms" is a first-person puzzle-adventure game where players navigate through a series of complex, maze-like rooms. Each room presents unique challenges and puzzles that must be solved to progress. The game mechanics involve exploration, item collection, puzzle-solving, and occasional stealth elements to avoid unseen threats. Players must strategically use their wits and resources to navigate the eerie and seemingly endless rooms.

### Storyline:
In "Escape from Backrooms," you will be relentlessly pursued by a savage monster in an oppressive hospital. Starting from a concealed room, you must break free and seize the opportunity to reach the lobby stealthily, then find the only way out of the monsterâ€™s clutches. The exit leads to an underground maze, a test of wit where every choice is crucial. After navigating the maze, you will enter a decrepit factory, which serves as the final battleground. Here, you may discover a weapon to confront the monster. In a heart-pounding climax, you will face your pursuer. Uncover the mysteries of the Backrooms, stand against it, fight to reclaim your reality, or become another lost soul under its dominion.
